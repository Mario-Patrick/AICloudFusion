# AI Cloud Fusion — Lab Guides

Welcome to the AI Cloud Fusion workshop lab guides. These hands-on labs accompany the weekly workshop sessions and are designed to be completed independently using only the instructions in each guide.

## Getting Started

**New here?** Start with [Lab 1A](session-01-cloud-concepts/lab-1a-aws-cli-setup.md) — it walks you through creating your AWS account and setting up everything you need from scratch. No prior experience required.

## How to Use These Labs

Each session has its own folder containing three labs at different difficulty levels:

| Level | What to Expect |
|-------|---------------|
| **Lab A (Beginner)** | Foundational setup or introductory concepts |
| **Lab B (Intermediate)** | Core hands-on task with multiple AWS services |
| **Lab C (Advanced)** | Real-world engineering task — you build something practical |

Work through the labs in order (A → B → C). Each lab includes:

- 📋 Copy-and-paste commands with clear instructions
- 🔄 Placeholders clearly marked so you know what to replace
- 💡 Annotations explaining what each service does and why
- ✅ Console checkpoints to verify your work visually
- 🧹 Cleanup/decommission steps so you don't incur any costs

*More sessions coming soon.*

## Prerequisites

- An email address, phone number, and credit/debit card (for AWS account creation)
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- No prior AWS or cloud experience needed — Lab 1A covers everything from scratch

## Cost

All labs use **Always Free** AWS resources and include cleanup steps at the end. Each lab has a cost notice listing every service used and confirming the estimated cost is $0.00. **Always complete the Cleanup section at the end of each lab** to ensure no resources are left running.

## Need Help?

If you get stuck on any lab, post your question in the **Lab Help** channel on Microsoft Teams. Include:
1. The **command** you ran (copy and paste it)
2. The **full error message** you received
3. Which **step number** you are on
